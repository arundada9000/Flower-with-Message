### 💬 Update the Text Messages

![Edit Text](./preview/text.png)

There are **two messages** in this project:

- One **before** the photo appears.
- One **after** the photo appears.

You can find and edit them at the bottom of the `index.html` file inside the `<script>` tag:

```js
const text1 = "Your first message here 💌";
const text2 = "Your second message here 🌹";
```

```js
const text1 = "A rose for you, my love 🌷";
const text2 = "Even this rose fades in your beauty 💖";
```
